## Project Overview

Professional sports leagues experience significant growth and transformation over their years of existence. We set out to analyze the progression of the National Hockey League (NHL) over the last 100 years through performance and fan engagement data. This project will predict each season’s playoff participants and show the impact that team stats such as goals scored per game, penalty minutes incurred, etc. have on a team’s playoff chances.


### Background

Hockey is one of the most popular sports in North America. The National Hockey League (NHL) was founded in 1917 and has experienced significant growth and transformation over the years. As a professional league develops, teams improve every facet of their organizations, from arenas and fan engagement to coaching, player acquisition and development. There is also an improvement over time in the players themselves. Professional athletes in general have become bigger, faster, stronger and more specialized as compared to their predecessors.
In each NHL game, teams earn 2 points for a win, 1 point for an overtime loss, and 0 points for a regulation loss. These points are kept over the course of a season and used for the league standings and to determine the playoff teams and seeds at the end of the season.
 
### Questions We Hope to Answer with Data

- On a per game basis, did noticeable shifts occur over time in relation to team performance? How can these fluctuations be explained when considering the evolution of offensive and defensive philosophies?
- Most professional sports leagues have developed a goal of achieving a competitive balance (evidenced by the introduction of salary caps, player drafts, among others…). This in theory improves the product league-wide and gives teams a better chance to win any given game. Is this competitive balance exhibited when assessing a team’s point output in a given season?


### Approach:

We began this project by examining the overarching evolution of the NHL league over time across various areas, including but not limited to team and player performance, accomplishments and awards, NHL drafts, and playoff chances. Eventually, we opted to develop a machine learning model capable of predicting the playoff chances of each NHL team. For this purpose, we utilized data spanning the 1979-2011 NHL seasons as the basis for our predictions.
