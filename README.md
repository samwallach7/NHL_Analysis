## Project Overview

Professional sports leagues experience significant growth and transformation over their years of existence. We set out to analyze the progression of the National Hockey League (NHL) over the last 100 years through performance and fan engagement data. This project will predict each season’s playoff participants and show the impact that team stats such as goals scored per game, penalty minutes incurred, etc. have on a team’s playoff chances.


### Background

 Hockey is one of the most popular sports in North America. The National Hockey League (NHL) was founded in 1917 and has experienced significant growth and transformation over the years. As a professional league develops, teams improve every facet of their organizations, from arenas and fan engagement to coaching, player acquisition and development. There is also an improvement over time in the players themselves. Professional athletes in general have become bigger, faster, stronger and more specialized as compared to their predecessors.
