<h3 style="margin: 30px;"><u>KMeans Clustering</u></h3>
<p style="margin: 30px;">The team performance dataset was condensed to build a KMeans model
   that predicted a team’s qualification for the playoffs. Multiple variations were created 
   with the Points earned per game as the y value in the plot, (1) using the Goals For per game,
    (2) using the Goals Against per game and (3) using the Goal Spread (Goals For per game - 
    Goals Against per game). The elbow method lead us to utilize 4 clusters for each of these 
    models. Of these clusters, there were 2 clusters each that displayed teams that missed the
     playoffs and teams that made the playoffs. The clusters joined datapoints with similar 
     point per game and goal output characteristics. <br><br>

  Using Goals For: <br> <br>
  
  Clusters 0 and 2 made the playoffs while clusters 1 and 3 did not. <br><br>
  <img src="#" alt=""><br>
  Using Goals Against: <br><br>

  Clusters 0 and 3 made the playoffs while clusters 1 and 2 did not.
  <img src="#" alt=""><br>
  Using the spread between goals for and goals against (per game): <br><br>

  Clusters 0 and 2 made the playoffs while clusters 1 and 3 did not.

  <img src="#" alt=""><br>

  On the Goal Spread plot, note that there are some teams with a negative goal spread that made the 
  playoffs and conversely teams with a positive goal spread that did not make the playoffs. 
  Of these cases, there seem to be more instances of the former than the latter. <br><br>

  This data also shows that a statistical threshold for guaranteeing qualification for the playoffs is a Goal Spread value of at least 0.3.</p>

  <h3 style="margin: 30px;"><u>Logistic Regression</u></h3>

  <p style="margin: 30px;">The team performance dataset was also utilized to construct a logistic regression to predict playoff 
  qualification. After testing different combinations of data, the model we chose to utilize had a target 
  value of “made_playoff” (a Bernoulli value of whether the team made the playoffs or not) and features values
   of goals for per game, goals allowed per game, power play goal efficiency (percent of the time a team 
   scored when on a power play) and penalty kill efficiency (percent of the time a team did not allow a goal when 
   short-handed). <br><br>

   We conducted a train_test_split, fit the model with the training data, and predicted the Bernoulli outputs 
   for making the playoffs. We arrived at a model with 90% overall accuracy and for the predictions of making the 
   playoffs, a 0.89 precision and a 0.97 recall.

  </p>


<h3 style="margin: 30px;"><u>Linear Regression Model</u></h3>
<p style="margin: 30px;">
<ul>
  <li><strong>Points Prediction:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Mean Squared Error(MSE): 0.03025
      </li>
      <li>
        R-squared (R²): 0.972
      </li>
      <li>
        The model performs exceptionally well in predicting points, with a high R² value 
        indicating that it explains 97.2% of the variance in points based on the features 
        in the dataset. The low MSE suggests that the model's predictions are 
        close to the actual points scored by players.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Goals Prediction:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Mean Squared Error(MSE): 0.04619
      </li>
      <li>
        R-squared (R²): 0.956
      </li>
      <li>
        For goals prediction, the model also demonstrates strong performance, with an R² 
        value of 0.956. This indicates that 95.6% of the variance in goals can be explained 
        by the model. The MSE for goals is low, indicating accurate predictions.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <br>
  <li><strong>Assists Prediction:</strong>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Mean Squared Error(MSE): 0.03666
      </li>
      <li>
        R-squared (R²): 0.967
      </li>
      <li>
        Similarly, the model performs well in predicting assists, with an R² value of 0.967,
         indicating that 96.7% of the variance in assists is explained by the model. The MSE 
         for assists is also low, suggesting accurate predictions.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <br>  
</ul>
</p>
<p style="margin: 30px;">
Overall, the model demonstrates strong predictive capabilities for player performance metrics,
but further validation and consideration of recent trends and factors are advised when using 
the model for predictions in the present day.
